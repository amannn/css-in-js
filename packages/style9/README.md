# style9

Problems:
- Can't import theme from other file
  - Problematic for accessing a theme (however CSS vars work)
  - Problematic at least for spacing, media queries etc. though
- No selectors? How to do owl selector?
- Can't compose parent selector into component.

Nice to have:
- Only longhand properties are supported (https://github.com/johanholmerin/style9/issues/15#issuecomment-709266637)
